# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

In this project, I learned about sets and dictionaries in Python. I practiced using them
with the `lambda`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` methods.


* **0. Squared simple**
  * [0-square_matrix_simple.py](./0-square_matrix_simple.py): Python function that computes
  the square value of all integers of a matrix.
  * The parameter `matrix` is a two-dimensional array.
  * Returns a matrix of the same size as `matrix` where each value is the
  square of the input value.
  * The initial matrix is not modified.
  * Without importing modules.
